## A New Post

idea 1: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)s
	I discovered the GAN neural network system at the start of this class, and ever since I have been infatuated with the technology and the expanse of its potential. Personally I have even begun developing my own GAN networks and experimenting with the technology in the context of art making. Through my extensive personal research I have already conducted I belive the GAN to be one of the most important AI networks currently in existance, and I belive that it is, and will, in the upcoming years influence visual culture beyond even the GUI. In the art world I belive its capabilities could excede that of the paint brush and render technologies like the video camera or image capture obselete. The general concept of the Generative Adversarial Network is expansive beyond simple image generation, ranging from such capabilities as text to image rendering or video generative gan programs. Not only is the technology itself rich with writing potential exploring the ethics of the GAN aswell as its contribution to things such as deep fakes, would make for a rich subject of research. 
    
idea 2: GPT-2 (Predictive text)
	Predictive text programs have become a staple of modern comunication. Apple's predictive text algorithms becoming a major componant of day to day life and text. The possibilities of programs like the more advanced GPT-2 are seemingly endless. Through the GPT-2 interactive sites made available by Open Source AI I personally have already been able to test many of its capabilities and can't wait to see how it continues to develop. From the information I have already gathered the history of predicitive text seems to go as far back as 1951 when Chinese typesetter, Zhang Jiying, arranged Chinese characters in associative clusters. Like the many other entries in the "100 ideas that changed the web" predictive text seems like it would easily fall right into the fold of the other material. 
    
Idea 3: Bots
	One of the most shocking elements left out of the book was the "Bot". Not only do Bot technologies account for 50% of all online traffic (web crawlers, search engines, siri/alexa) they're more mallicious examples (spam, DDoS, Trojan horses, keylogging, political social media tools) are equally as pervasive and influential. Within the last few years the BOT has almost taken on a second meaning refrencing social media profiles opperated by repetitive scripts, potentially for mallitous intent such as the perpetuation of fake news. This technology has not only shaped the digital ecology and online spaces we interact with but has increasingly more and more physical impact everyday. There is no shortage of information on the Bot, whether it is the technolgy itself or the current events or historical implications. 
    
Idea 4: Deep Fakes
	The "deep fake" is one of the most increasingly talked about pieces of digital inovation right now. Although the technology itself is truly only just being perfected the potential mallitious implications that the deepfake could have are vast and the subject of much talk. The history of image manipulation is as old as photography itself, becoming even more developed with the advent of the digital camera and video recorder. The deep fake itself is a perfect example of deep learning AI and generative neural networks at work, both of which are world shaping technologies. Because of social interest on the deep fake and its increasing use in hollywood films and pornography the internet is rife with information. 
    
Idea 5: volumetric display
	The idea of vollumetric displays have been a science fiction fascniation since the early 1900's. Since pretty much the begining of the moving image we have wanted to experience that phenomonon in 3 dimensional space, as close to our optical experience as possbile. It's only been until relitivly recently that we have been able to make the holograms of science fiction a reality. As this technology develops there's no limit to how it will change the user interface of the web and all visual comunication media going foward. The development of the volumetric display is an incredibly rich one as there have been numerous technolgies as early as the stereoscope that have attempted to create a volumetric viewing experience.
