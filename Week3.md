1. In a 2016 technology report done by the news outlet the Atlantic, Benj Edwards talks about his formative experiences with BBSes he interacted with during his childhood. Besdies citing some local nondescript BBSes like: BBSing,“Octopus’s Garden,” “Southern Pride,” and “Online's Place.” Edwards goes on to cite the specifics of some BBSes like such as "The Keep" where users could leaf through advice in how to avoid Y2K related disasters aswell as play text based games through the IBM OS/2 operating system. As I continued my own search into the BBSes of the past I found lists of noteable bulletins ranging in topics from forums on Dungeons and Dragons(DNDBBS), LGBT information pages like (GLIB) aswell as bulletins devoted to Pagan and Neopagan descussion (The Brewer's Witch). My attempts to find a BBS that is still fully operational yeiled to be very succsessful as I first came across a site called "The Cave". I was sadly not able to telenet into the bulletin, but it claims to still be functioning. I also came across a site dedicated to listing active BBSes to date:https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/bbs/list/detail/. They even boast as having 591 active BBSes listed. 

2. In 2009 a group called "The Archive Team" rushed to download as much of the pages on the GeoCities servers before Yahoo! could delete them forever. The entirety of the available Geosites saved by The Archive Team take up about 652GB with each page being no more than 10MB. Not only did the group make this available to the public via torrent there are some sites devoted to the maintance and catalouging of the thousands of GeoCities pages. The most notable of which is the site Oocities.org, which is devoted to restoring and catalouging the GeoCity pages and neighborhoods seeing them as a valuable piece of our web history. The site runs entirely on voulanteers and still looks for people to translate the Oocities site into any and all languges as well as further organization so that every salvaged is able to be seen and safe.
